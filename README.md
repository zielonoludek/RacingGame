 First Future Games Assignment 

Create a 2D or 3D racing game with the following design specifications:

- Should be a racing game with a fixed top down or isometric camera that shows the entire track
- The track should have a shape of a certain width, with walls that define the shape
- Game should be up to 2 players, same screen, (split-screen is NOT a requirement). Multiplayer is not required but encouraged.
- Control should be on the same keyboard, or keyboard/mouse
- Game should use Unity Physics
- The two players should be able to bump in each other and with the race walls
- Some basic physics should be implemented to control the cars but not too complicated like independent wheel controls or anything like that
- The tracks should contain some simple power ups that alter the car speed or friction
- There should be 3 levels - you may use the same scene to generate the track or different scenes which involved having a SceneManager to switch between them
- The game should have a Main Menu for starting a new game etc
- The game should have a Pause menu for existing the current game
- Use Asset Store or other sources for free assets to build the track
- You may ask a friend artist to help, if you wish
- Using external resources for help is allowed, but plagiarism is not allowed. Add the sources of you inspiration to your assignment presentation
- You may use any sort of controller support

Nice to have:
- Use the new InputSystem to control the cars. You may use the old one as well.
- Leaderboards that are saved with the game between sessions
- A simple car selector and customization UI
- Cars can have health and fuel!
- You are allowed to have some sort of enemies shooting at you
