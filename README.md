# RacingGame
Final assignment of "Fundamentals of C# Programming with Unity3D Engine" course led by Sebastian Bularca.
I created simple local multiplayer kart racing game. 

I tried to write optimalised, easy to understand code. First time I used as many managers in my game. Crating them I learned how useful they are. I didn't use advanced math, I wanted to focus on code structures Sebastian showed us during the curse.

Used Packages: Input System

To play game in editor, random scene from Assets/Scenes should be loaded.
